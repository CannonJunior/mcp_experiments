## Prompt: Write a Python MCP server with FastMCP. The server's tool should reads json data from a KafkaConsumer.

I've created a comprehensive Kafka MCP server using FastMCP. Here are the key features:
Tools Provided:

kafka_consume_messages - Consumes JSON messages from a Kafka topic

Configurable timeout, max messages, bootstrap servers
Automatic JSON deserialization
Returns messages with full metadata (partition, offset, timestamp, etc.)


kafka_peek_messages - Peeks at messages without committing offsets

Useful for inspecting messages without affecting consumer groups
Can specify partition and offset position


kafka_list_topics - Lists available Kafka topics with partition information
kafka_close_consumer - Closes specific consumers to free resources

Additional Features:

Resource: kafka://config - Shows active consumers and configuration
Prompt: kafka_usage - Provides usage instructions
Consumer Management: Automatically manages consumer lifecycle
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for Kafka operations
Graceful Shutdown: Properly closes consumers on server shutdown

Installation Requirements:
bashpip install fastmcp kafka-python
Usage Examples:
# Consume messages from a topic
messages = await kafka_consume_messages(
    topic="user-events",
    bootstrap_servers="localhost:9092",
    max_messages=10
)

# Peek at latest messages without committing
peek_messages = await kafka_peek_messages(
    topic="user-events",
    offset="latest",
    max_messages=5
)

# List available topics
topics = await kafka_list_topics(bootstrap_servers="localhost:9092")

Configuration:
The server supports standard Kafka consumer configurations:

Bootstrap servers (comma-separated)
Consumer group IDs
Auto-offset reset policies
Custom timeouts and message limits

To Run:
python kafka_mcp_server.py

The server will start and be ready to consume JSON data from your Kafka topics. It automatically handles consumer lifecycle management and provides a clean interface for MCP clients to interact with Kafka data streams.
