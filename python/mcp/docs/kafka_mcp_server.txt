## Prompt: Write a Python MCP server with FastMCP. The server's tool should reads json data from a KafkaConsumer.

I've created a comprehensive Kafka MCP server using FastMCP. Here are the key features:
Tools Provided:

kafka_consume_messages - Consumes JSON messages from a Kafka topic

Configurable timeout, max messages, bootstrap servers
Automatic JSON deserialization
Returns messages with full metadata (partition, offset, timestamp, etc.)


kafka_peek_messages - Peeks at messages without committing offsets

Useful for inspecting messages without affecting consumer groups
Can specify partition and offset position


kafka_list_topics - Lists available Kafka topics with partition information
kafka_close_consumer - Closes specific consumers to free resources

Additional Features:

Resource: kafka://config - Shows active consumers and configuration
Prompt: kafka_usage - Provides usage instructions
Consumer Management: Automatically manages consumer lifecycle
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for Kafka operations
Graceful Shutdown: Properly closes consumers on server shutdown

Installation Requirements:
